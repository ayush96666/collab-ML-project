This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical features. Early prediction of heart-related conditions is critical for effective treatment and better patient outcomes.

We use a dataset containing medical information such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, ECG results, and more. By training various classification algorithms, we evaluate and compare their performance to find the most accurate model.
